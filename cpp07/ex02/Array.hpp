// Develop a class template Array that contains elements of type T and that implements
// the following behavior and functions:
// • Construction with no parameter: Creates an empty array.
// • Construction with an unsigned int n as a parameter: Creates an array of n elements
// initialized by default.
// Tip: Try to compile int * a = new int(); then display *a.
// • Construction by copy and assignment operator. In both cases, modifying either the
// original array or its copy after copying musn’t affect the other array.
// • You MUST use the operator new[] to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (al
// locating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non
// allocated memory.
// • Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].
// • When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an
// std::exception is thrown.
// • Amember function size() that returns the number of elements in the array. This
// member function takes no parameters and must not modify the current instance.
